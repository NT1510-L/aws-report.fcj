## Internship Process Evaluation

Throughout my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **09/09/2025** to **13/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to experience a professional working environment, receive direct guidance from mentors, and gain hands-on practice with real AWS services. This period helped me strengthen my foundational knowledge, expand new skills, and better understand the deployment processes for cloud computing solutions.

### 1. Learning Process and Technical Development

During my internship, I participated in researching and building an **AI chatbot using Amazon Bedrock, Lambda, API Gateway, and S3**, through which I:

**Basic AWS Knowledge:**
- Gained a stronger understanding of the basic structure of VPC, EC2, IAM, S3, and CloudFront
- Learned how to set up security groups and network ACLs
- Understood how to manage permissions and roles in IAM
- Practiced backup and restore operations for data on S3

**Application Development:**
- Practiced deploying applications using serverless architecture with AWS Lambda
- Learned how to design REST APIs using API Gateway
- Learned how to integrate AWS services together to create complete solutions
- Understood how to apply AI/LLM models through Amazon Bedrock

**Programming Skills:**
- Improved Python/JavaScript programming skills in a more practical direction
- Learned to write clean code with clear structure
- Practiced debugging and troubleshooting when encountering errors
- Understood best practices when working with cloud services

Through assigned tasks, I gained understanding of standard work processes, documentation writing, progress reporting, and coordination with mentors when facing technical challenges.
