> I would like to share my reflections on my internship at AWS Vietnam. I hope these notes are useful for the FCJ team and for future interns.

### Overall impression

**1. Work environment**  The working environment at AWS Vietnam is professional and motivating. The modern office at Bitexco Financial Tower is an inspiring place to work. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which helped me stay focused. The atmosphere is energetic without being overly stressful, making it easier to learn and grow.

**2. Mentor & admin support**  My mentor provided patient, clear guidance and encouraged questions. The admin team supported onboarding and documentation, which made it easier to get started. I appreciated being given chances to try solving problems on my own rather than being handed solutions.

**3. Relevance to my studies**  The tasks I worked on matched what I learned at university and also exposed me to new topics. This balance helped me strengthen foundational knowledge while gaining practical experience.

**4. Learning and skill development**  This internship offered strong opportunities to improve both technical and professional skills—teamwork, communication, and time management. Mr. Hoang Van Kha shared valuable practical advice that helped me shape my career direction.

**5. Culture and team spirit**  The company culture is positive: people are respectful, focused, and also friendly. When urgent work arises, teammates readily offer help, which made me feel included despite being an intern.

**6. Intern policies & benefits**  The internship provided a stipend and flexible hours when needed. Internal training sessions and workshops were particularly helpful for learning new skills.

### Questions & feedback

### Suggestions & closing thoughts

- Key suggestions:

    * **Community building:** Increase opportunities for in-person meetups so interns feel more connected to colleagues and company culture.

    * **Knowledge sharing:** Hold more in-depth internal sessions where mentors or teams share practical experience across domains.

- I would welcome the chance to continue working with the program or contribute to future projects—this internship has been an excellent environment for both technical and personal growth.

- Final note: I sincerely thank the company and the FCJ team for their support and guidance during my internship. I hope these observations help improve the program for future cohorts.
